## Currencies

#### Weapon Crates

- Save these as best you can for day 1500+, they come slow and are needed for the best weapons.
- Generally speaking you want to open these using a button to open x50 which guarantees a Gold tier weapon.
- Obtained the first time you beat a boss every 5 levels, purchased with Keys, or purchased with Fossils.

#### Hero Tickets

- Open these x10 at a time to guarantee at least one Purple tier hero.
- These are very slow in the early game, but plentiful in the late game.

#### Rubies

- Red gems obtained from achievements, or selling crate weapons
- These come very slow for the whole game
- Most important priorities to spend on are:
  - Elixir boosting walls
  - Friend slots (for more Amity)
  - Hero slots
  - 1 or 2 unlocks of Rune Slots/Equipment Slots when you need it
  - Awaken rerolls (200 rubies)

#### Keys

- Keys obtained in Dungeon Mode
- Shop Price reset weekly
- Buy Weapon Crates (do not spend more than 5000 keys per crate)
- Can Buy Hero Tickets (do not spend more than 5000 keys per ticket)
- Buy Hero Catalysts (to upgrade heroes, will need lots)

#### Fossils (Bones)

- Bones obtained in Expedition Mode
- Stock resets weekly
- Buy Rubies
- Buy Weapon Crates
- Can buy Hero Tickets
- Never waste on lesser runes/regular runes
- Will spend mostly on Greater Runes
- Caladbolg for 200 is useful to buy around day 300 - 1500, etc to help you keep out of crates

#### Amity (Hearts)

- Hearts obtained daily from friends list
- Buy Rubies
- Buy Weapon Crates
- Eventually you will want to buy all Hero Evolutions

#### Sapphire

- Blue gem obtained daily from Guild
- Buy Time Stones (1 sapphire for 64 Time Stones at day 500+)

#### Time Stones

- Green gems obtained by rewinding (Unlocked on day 51)
- Reduces number of waves you fight per day
- Try to keep enough Time Stones so you only fight 1 wave per day
- Rewinding from day 1000 - 2000 is slow so many guides recommend rewinding until you have 2304 Time Stones before passing day 1000 (older guides say day 530)

#### Elixir

- Pink currency obtained by rewinding (Unlocked on day 51)
- Used to upgrade skills, the primary method of increasing your power over time

#### Catalysts

- Several types of catalysts exist
- Heroes need different catalysts to upgrade
- When you buy a catalyst, you get a random one for 10k Keys
- If you need 5x of a catalyst, you might spend 500k keys and not get the ones you need

## Skills

### General

- Spend Elixir to first discover skills, then upgrade them
- The last skill costs ~45M elixir to unlock
- Additive skills (Like Hidden Strength) aren't as good as multiplicative skills (Like Untapped Power) because they get drowned out to irrelevance by scale of other upgrades
- Rewinding in the early game sucks until you unlock/upgrade these skills
  - Elixir Mastery (more elixir per rewind)
  - Time Jump (keep some days on rewind)
  - Deja Vu (keep some stats on rewind)

### Awakening skills

After all skills are unlocked, you can begin to Awaken skills. Awakened skills have a massive increase in their effectiveness. These are the priority skills you want to awaken. If you are in your first 9 awakenings and don't see one of these skills, you should probably reroll.

1. Time Jump
2. Elixir Mastery
3. Runic Affinity
4. Beautiful Disaster
5. Untapped Power
6. Hard Labor
7. Inspire
8. Boss Slayer
9. Monster Slayer
10. Deja Vu
11. Bargaining Chip

## Gameplay

### General Play

- Progress until new waves have 2x waves per day or day is hard to beat.
- If 2x waves per day:
  - Rewind farming Time Stones until 1x wave per day.
  - Put Elixir 3 Elixir Mastery.
- If hard to beat
  - Rewind farming elixir to power up skills

### Day 1 - 50

Just do your best to survive until you can start rewinding. When you do your first rewind, you lose all money and stats. You do this to gain elixir and start unlocking skills. If you're going to open an early game weapon crate, when you do your first reset isn't a terrible day to open one.

### Day 51 - 300

Focus on unlocking Elixir Mastery, Time Jump, Deja Vu. Once those are unlocked, put most of your elixir into Elixir Master when you reset. In the late game, you'll want Elixir Mastery to be at 2x-3x your next highest skill.

### Day 301 - Day 1000

Around day 300 you can finally farm Fossils fast enough to be worth buying a Caladbolg. Buy new ones if the old one gets too underpowered on your march to day 1000. Focus on unlocking all skills during this push. When I start producing ~25m elixir per day, I do 2x rewinds to unlock the final skill. Once all skills are unlocked, you can start to awaken them.

### Day 1000+

See a [better guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZBD3OQuU0kuBt3L-s7zq__QWxjnge1meVs5B_nke9nM/edit?tab=t.0).

## Early game ignorables

- Spells become irrelevant pretty fast unless you farm caster equipment/runes.
- Equipment from low tier Hunts doesn't do much and isn't worth upgrading.
- Runes are too expensive to farm and do too little early game to be worth farming.
