## Skills

### General

- Spend Elixir to first discover skills, then upgrade them
- The last skill costs ~45M elixir to unlock
- Additive skills (Like Hidden Strength) aren't as good as multiplicative skills (Like Untapped Power) because they get drowned out to irrelevance by scale of other upgrades
- Rewinding in the early game sucks until you unlock/upgrade these skills
  - Elixir Mastery (more elixir per rewind)
  - Time Jump (keep some days on rewind)
  - Deja Vu (keep some stats on rewind)

### Awakening skills

After all skills are unlocked, you can begin to Awaken skills. Awakened skills have a massive increase in their effectiveness. These are the priority skills you want to awaken. If you are in your first 9 awakenings and don't see one of these skills, you should probably reroll.

4. Beautiful Disaster
5. Untapped Power
6. Hard Labor
