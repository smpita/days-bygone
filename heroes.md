## Heroes

### Hero Tickets

- Unlock heroes by opening hero tickets
- Open these x10 at a time to guarantee at least one Purple tier hero.
- B.C. events that occur every 5 rewinds is main source of tickets
- These are very slow in the early game, but plentiful in the late game.
- Gold tier heroes typically are the better but take many more catalysts and tickets to level, so do consider using low tier heroes. My best pushing team at `Day 4000` includes `Paul` evolved to `Saul`, `Hank` evolved to `Hank Soulbringer`, `Arthur` without his evolution, `Mikhail`, and `Roland`.
- You'll likely want to upgrade all heroes for a hero only game mode that opens around `Day 2000`, Fates Labyrinth so don't be afraid to level/use white/blue/purple tier heroes.

### Hero Growth

- A heroes level is not the strength of that hero but how many tickets you have for them
- When a hero hits their "ascension level" you use [Catalysts](currencies.md#catalysts) to give them a `*`
- You will want to `10*` most of the heroes but this isn't really relevant until `Day 2000 - 3000`
- The branch order that you level the skills for a hero matters as it will take a long time to fill the whole tree. Refer to the [Book of Heroes](heroes.md#official-discord-library) on the official Discord or ask if you don't want to join the Discord for the optimal paths.

### Hero Choices

- The heroes have a series of pros and cons that make recommending teams difficult without knowing both the meta and which heroes were ascended
- Before `Day 2000`, just use whoever has the most `*`s
- After `Day 2000`, see Official Discord resources
- Current [evolution](currencies.md#amity-hearts) order: `Paul` > `Hank` > `Fred`/`Cherry` (`Cherry` if close to day 3000) > `Greg` > `Arthur`

# Situational/Low Performing heroes

These recommendations are based on a quick review of the [Book of Heroes](https://discord.com/channels/570929677732937738/1069087238949982338), my take might be wrong so take with a grain of salt.

Delay spending resources on these unless you know what you're doing or get to the Labyrinth.

- `Job` - Only consider if playing Mage style
- `Merlin` - Mainly consider if playing Mage style
- `Iseria` - Niche use
- `Clarissa` - Outperformed by `Sieg`
- `Elaine` - Outperformed by `Hank` but niche use in `Expedition mode`
- `Greg` - Good early, Outperformed by many
- `Zare`
- `Pike`
- `Cusack`
- `Chandler`
