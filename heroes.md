## Heroes

### Hero Tickets

- Unlock heroes by opening hero tickets
- Open these x10 at a time to guarantee at least one Purple tier hero.
- B.C. events that occur every 5 rewinds is main source of tickets
- These are very slow in the early game, but plentiful in the late game.

### Hero Growth

- A heroes level is not the strength of that hero but how many tickets you have for them
- When a hero hits their "ascension level" you use [Catalysts](currencies.md#catalysts) to give them a `*`
- You will want to `10*` most of the heroes but this isn't really relevant until `Day 2000 - 3000`

### Hero Choices

- The heroes have a series of pros and cons that make recommending teams difficult without knowing both the meta and which heroes were ascended
- Before `Day 2000`, just use whoever has the most `*`s
- After `Day 2000`, see Official Discord resources
- Current [evolution](currencies.md#amity-hearts) order: `Paul` > `Hank` > `Fred`/`Cherry` (`Cherry` if close to day 3000) > `Greg` > `Arthur` > `Job`
